<h2>Green e-grocery</h2>
<h3>Nowadays people are getting busy. Even though the e-commerce has made so much of our work easy, 
farmers need to sell their products (grocery) to merchants in a low rate and customer is forced to buy the product in a huge rate. 
Here the merchants or the middleman is making a large profit and the owner is not. We solve this issue by discarding the middleman.
Our aim is to design a classified web site in which the people can sell their home-grown products and also people can buy high quality organic vegetables and fruits in a reasonable price. 
Admin has a broad range of administrative privileges across the site, primarily managing the infrastructure and to lead and guide team members to accomplish the administration department goals. He or she has the access to all the functionalities over the website. The people who are registering in the site can sell their products by uploading the details of the product and the seller. Customers can buy these products using these platform.
With this, the seller and customer can make a huge profit without a middleman and the customer can have organic vegetables and fruits.
This site is implemented using different programming languages such as PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and HTML.
